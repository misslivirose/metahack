##Parsing the Star Wars API
The GetSWAPI.cs file provides an interface for the GET request that is sent to the SWAPI.co site to retrieve the planet information when the user triggers a click (touch) on a specific planet. SWAPI sends back a JSON object that is then parsed by the `ExtractPlanetData()` function and displays the corresponding information (name, climate, terrain, population, and gravity) onto the on screen UI.
